# Changelog

All notable changes to Lidify will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.3] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Backend unresponsiveness after hours of uptime:** Replaced `setInterval` with self-rescheduling `setTimeout` for the 2-minute reconciliation cycle and 5-minute Lidarr cleanup cycle in `workers/index.ts`. Previously, `setInterval` fired unconditionally every 2/5 minutes regardless of whether the previous cycle had completed. Since `withTimeout()` resolves via `Promise.race` but never cancels the underlying operation, timed-out operations continued running as zombies. Over hours, hundreds of concurrent zombie operations accumulated, starving the event loop and exhausting database connections and network sockets. Each cycle now waits for the previous one to fully complete before scheduling the next, making pile-up impossible.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **GPU acceleration:** CLAP vibe embeddings use GPU when available (NVIDIA Container Toolkit required); MusicCNN stays on CPU where it performs better due to small model size
- **GPU documentation:** README section with install commands for NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Fedora/Nobara/RHEL and Ubuntu/Debian), docker-compose GPU config, and verification steps
- **Model idle unloading:** Both MusicCNN and CLAP analyzers unload ML models after idle timeout, freeing 2-4 GB of RAM when not processing
- **Immediate model unload:** Analyzers detect when all work is complete and unload models immediately instead of waiting for the idle timeout
- **CLAP progress reporting:** Enrichment progress endpoint now includes CLAP processing count and queue length for accurate UI status
- **Discovery similar artists:** Search discover endpoint returns musically similar artists (via Last.fm `getSimilar`) separately from text-match results
- **Alias resolution banner:** UI banner shown when Last.fm resolves an artist name alias (e.g., "of mice" -> "Of Mice & Men")

### Fixed

- **Case-sensitive artist search ([#64](https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/issues/64)):** Added PostgreSQL tsvector search with ILIKE fallback; all artist/album/track searches are now case-insensitive
- **Circuit breaker false trips:** Audio analysis cleanup circuit breaker now counts cleanup runs instead of individual tracks, preventing premature breaker trips on large batches of stale tracks
- **DB reconciliation race condition:** Analyzer marks tracks as `processing` in the database before pushing to Redis queue, preventing the backend from double-queuing the same tracks
- **Enrichment completion detection:** `isFullyComplete` now checks CLAP processing count and queue length, not just completed vs total
- **Search special characters:** `queryToTsquery` strips non-word characters and filters empty terms, preventing PostgreSQL syntax errors on queries like `"&"` or `"..."`
- **NaN pagination limit:** Search endpoints guard against `NaN` limit values from malformed query params
- **Discovery cache key collisions:** Normalized cache keys (lowercase, trimmed, collapsed whitespace) prevent duplicate cache entries for equivalent queries
- **Worker resize pool churn:** Added 5-second debounce to worker count changes from the UI slider, preventing rapid pool destroy/recreate cycles

### Performance

- **malloc_trim memory recovery:** Both analyzers call `malloc_trim(0)` after unloading models, forcing glibc to return freed pages to the OS (6.5 GB active -> 2.0 GB idle)
- **MusicCNN worker pool auto-shutdown:** Worker pool shuts down when no pending work remains, freeing process pool memory without waiting for idle timeout
- **Enrichment queue batch size:** Reduced from 50 to 10 to match analyzer batch size, preventing buildup of stale `processing` tracks
- **Search with tsvector indexes:** Artist, album, and track tables now have generated tsvector columns with GIN indexes for fast full-text search
- **Discovery endpoint parallelized:** Artist search, similar artists, and Deezer image lookups run concurrently instead of sequentially

### Changed

- **Audio streaming range parser:** Replaced Express `res.sendFile()` with custom range parser supporting suffix ranges (`bytes=-N`) and proper 416 responses -- fixes Firefox/Safari streaming issues on large FLAC files
- **Similar artists separation:** Discovery results now split into `results` (text matches) and `similarArtists` (musically similar via Last.fm), replacing the mixed array
- **Last.fm search tightened:** Removed `getSimilarArtists` padding from `searchArtists()` and raised fuzzy match threshold from 50 to 75 to reduce false positives (e.g., "Gothica" matching "Mothica")

### Removed

- Dead enrichment worker (`backend/src/workers/enrichment.ts`) and mood bucket worker (`backend/src/workers/moodBucketWorker.ts`) -- functionality consolidated into unified enrichment worker
- Unused `useDebouncedValue` hook (replaced by `useDebounce` from search hooks)

### Contributors

- @Allram - Soulseek import fix ([#85](https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/pull/85))

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Doubled audio stream on next-track:** Fixed race condition where clicking next/previous played two streams simultaneously by making track-change cleanup synchronous and guarding the play/pause effect during loading
- **Soulseek download returns 400 (#101):** Frontend now sends parsed title to the download endpoint; backend derives artist/title from filename when not provided instead of rejecting the request
- **Admin password reset (#97):** Added `ADMIN_RESET_PASSWORD` environment variable support -- set it and restart to reset the admin password, then remove the variable
- **Retry failed audio analysis UI (#79):** Added "Retry Failed Analysis" button in Settings that resets permanently failed tracks back to pending for re-processing
- **Podcast auto-refresh (#81):** Podcasts now automatically refresh during the enrichment cycle (hourly), checking RSS feeds for new episodes without manual intervention
- **Compilation track matching (#70):** Added title-only fallback matching strategy for playlist reconciliation -- when album artist doesn't match (e.g. "Various Artists" compilations), tracks are matched by title with artist similarity scoring
- **Soulseek documentation (#27):** Expanded README with detailed Soulseek integration documentation covering setup, search, download workflow, and limitations
- **Admin route hardening:** Added `requireAdmin` middleware to onboarding config routes and stale job cleanup endpoint
- **2FA userId leak:** Removed userId from 2FA challenge response (information disclosure)
- **Queue bugs:** Fixed cancelJob/refreshJobMatches not persisting state, clear button was no-op, reorder not restarting track, shuffle indices not updating on removeFromQueue
- **Infinite re-render:** Fixed useAlbumData error handling causing infinite re-render loop
- **2FA status not loading:** Fixed AccountSection not loading 2FA status on mount
- **Password change error key mismatch:** Fixed error key mismatch in AccountSection password change handler
- **Discovery polling leak:** Fixed polling never stopping on batch failure
- **Timer leak:** Fixed withTimeout not clearing timer in enrichment worker
- **Audio play rejection:** Fixed unhandled promise rejection on audio.play()
- **Library tab validation:** Added tab parameter validation in library page
- **Onboarding state:** Separated success/error state in onboarding page
- **Audio analysis race condition (#79):** CLAP analyzer was clobbering Essentia's `analysisStatus` field, causing completed tracks to be reset and permanently failed after 3 cycles; both Python analyzers now check for existing embeddings before resetting
- **Enrichment completion check:** `isFullyComplete` now includes CLAP vibe embeddings, not just audio analysis
- **Enrichment UI resilience:** Added `keepPreviousData` and loading/error states to enrichment progress query so the settings block doesn't vanish on failed refetch

### Performance

- **Recommendation N+1 queries:** Eliminated N+1 queries in all 3 recommendation endpoints (60+ queries down to 3-5)
- **Idle worker pool shutdown:** Essentia analyzer shuts down its 8-worker process pool (~5.6 GB) after idle period, lazily restarts when work arrives

### Changed

- **Shared utility consolidation:** Replaced 10 inline `formatDuration` copies with shared `formatTime`/`formatDuration`, extracted `formatNumber` to shared utility, consolidated inline Fisher-Yates shuffle with shared `shuffleArray`
- **Player hook extraction:** Extracted shared `useMediaInfo` hook, eliminating ~120 lines of duplicated media info logic across MiniPlayer, FullPlayer, and OverlayPlayer
- **Preview hook consolidation:** Consolidated artist/album preview hooks into shared `useTrackPreview`
- **Redundant logging cleanup:** Removed console.error calls redundant with toast notifications or re-thrown errors

### Removed

- Dead player files: VibeOverlay, VibeGraph, VibeOverlayContainer, enhanced-vibe-test page
- Dead code: trackEnrichment.ts, discover/types/index.ts, unused artist barrel file
- Unused exports: `playTrack` from useLibraryActions, `useTrackDisplayData`/`TrackDisplayData` from useMetadataDisplay
- Unused `streamLimiter` middleware
- Deprecated `radiosByGenre` from browse API (Deezer radio requires account; internal library radio used instead)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-05

### Performance

- **Sequential audio/vibe enrichment:** Vibe phase skips when audio analysis is still running, preventing concurrent CPU-intensive Python analyzers from competing for resources
- **Faster enrichment cycles:** Reduced cycle interval from 30s to 5s; the rate limiter already handles API throttling, making the extra delay redundant
- **GPU auto-detection (CLAP):** PyTorch-based CLAP vibe embeddings auto-detect and use GPU when available, falling back to CPU
- **GPU auto-detection (Essentia):** TensorFlow-based audio analysis detects GPU with memory growth enabled, with device logging on startup

### Changed

- **Enrichment orchestration simplified:** Replaced 4 phase functions with duplicated stop/pause handling with a generic `runPhase()` executor and `shouldHaltCycle()` helper

### Fixed

- **Docker frontend routing:** Fixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` build-time env var in Dockerfile so the frontend correctly proxies API requests to the backend
- **Next.js rewrite proxy:** Updated rewrite config to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` for consistent build-time/runtime behavior
- **False lite mode on startup:** Feature detection now checks for analyzer scripts on disk, preventing false "lite mode" display before analyzers send their first heartbeat
- **Removed playback error banner:** Removed the red error bar from all player components (FullPlayer, MiniPlayer, OverlayPlayer) that displayed raw Howler.js error codes
- **Enrichment failure notifications:** Replaced aggressive per-cycle error banner with a single notification through the notification system when enrichment completes with failures

## [1.3.9] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- **Audio analysis cleanup:** Fixed race condition in audio analysis cleanup that could reset tracks still being processed

## [1.3.8] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Enrichment:** CLAP queue and failure cleanup fixes for enrichment debug mode

## [1.3.7] - 2026-02-01

```bash
# Backfill originalYear for existing albums
cd backend
npx ts-node scripts/backfill-original-year.ts
```

### Breaking Changes

- None - All changes are backward compatible

### Security

- **Critical:** Bull Board admin dashboard now requires authenticated admin user
- **Critical:** Lidarr webhooks verify signature/secret before processing requests
- **Critical:** Encryption key validation on startup prevents insecure defaults
- Session cookies use secure settings in production (httpOnly, sameSite=strict, secure)
- Swagger API documentation requires authentication in production (unless `DOCS_PUBLIC=true`)
- JWT tokens have proper expiration (24h access, 30d refresh) with refresh token support
- Password changes invalidate all existing tokens via tokenVersion increment
- Transaction-based download job creation prevents race conditions
- Enrichment stop control no longer bypassed by worker state
- Download queue webhook handlers use Serializable isolation transactions
- Webhook race conditions protected with exponential backoff retry logic
